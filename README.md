# face_recognition

We intend to perform face recognition. Face recognition means that for a given image you can tell the 
subject id. Our database of subject is very simple. It has 40 subjects. 

Dataset used is https://www.kaggle.com/kasikrit/att-database-of-faces

PCA and LDA were performed on the data and then classified using KNN with 1,3,5,7,9 neighbours.
